              "[{'transcript': \"and then we can take from there. Sure, Okay, just so we're really pleased to introduce Daniel and George to, to the team here, We've got the right representation of technical people to capture your requirements today and obviously see how we proceed from there. Um What we're gonna do is is very much hand over to you for this meeting and you can talk us through the vision um and the depth that you shared with us ahead of the meeting, which has been shared internally from there, we're going to, this can be driven by paranoia, who's on the call. Um and then we're going to, we're going to just listen intently. We may come back with a few questions. Um and we'll take from there now the school is recording. So if you'd like to start an introduction and you can make a brief introduction jewels to yourself and fantastic products. Yeah, so I'm creating a, hopefully creating a decentralized sports book that is, as you know, from the white paper backed off the liquidity pools in the crypto crypto what defy sphere? Um I think the biggest problems, obviously, I think that we're going to have is making sure that it's built on the Blockchain that's going to be able to handle um this kind of uh, the amount of processes involved from start to finish. Um you know, we've got a long term vision is to have decentralized data feeds feeding into the platform that obviously then we have a we have the whole bet process being in escrow, No 1's ever deposited on the platform. Um, so I mean if I don't know if I can share my share my screen on this. Yeah, you've got sharing sharing rights. Let me know if you can see the icon. Oh yeah, sorry, that's it. Um, host disabled participant screen chang. I'm really very sorry about that. Mm hmm. Adam you're about to host a terrible house. Uh mm I'm gonna make christian. I'm gonna make you host and just see if you can change those settings from your side. It's that I thought would be quite good just to bring up the protocol. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you should have had right so much to what's happening with the settings. So that's my around. Apologize for that. Uh can you are you able chris could you just make George co host for a second? I am trying to do that. Give me a minute. Daniels. Co host. That was why I clicked the wrong person. So that's my story. Okay, right, I'm nearly there share screen hosts disabled participants. Still, if you make a joke. Yeah, you can make uh daniel and also joe directly because uh can you just make sure? Yeah. Sorry, let me just uh allow all participants to share. Okay. Yeah they will be able to do it now. Perfect. That should be working. Uh huh. Mhm. Uh There you go. Do you know what it's not gonna let me do on my laptop actually just got your laptop. So I'll just say if you read the white paper and stuff obviously running through it um potential let me just try one more time. Do you want us to pull out the white paper? There we go. We're sharing. So as you can see obviously like a typical sports book uh feeds in uh you know feed him through a piece or the data to provide customers to bet with. And obviously we're just trying to bring in the process here to make it go on Shane for as much as possible Now unfortunately T. G. Labs couldn't join in this core but this company obviously specializes in providing sports betting solutions as you sure. You know, it's just pretty complex to be designing that all from scratch given the amount of markets and you know they're just established and it's much easier to come to market with a product that can be ready in a month. And they've obviously mentioned that they're happy to work with you guys too to design this flow. So obviously a traditional bookmaker doesn't have a decentralized data in. But for me this isn't the most important part to begin with. This would be great to have in the long term. The most important part is when you go to accept and you click the bats, it's going to be integrated with a mess a mask and that bet is recorded to be on chain and a oracle data feed is the only source to determine the outcome of that bet if you guys follow. Um So yeah, so that's that's that's for me that's the process which is going to be the most difficult handling all these back transactions. Of course, when someone might want to cash out a bet that will have to interact again when uh the liquidity pools obviously taking the risk of all these bets and then when you want to withdraw and deposit from a liquidity pool, they're going to have to take up to date feeds of the liability and exposure of of the platform if you see what I'm saying. Um So yeah, I guess for me from that perspective that's what I find is gonna be the hardest part to, to design, but I'm sure everything's possible and I know how to my mentions before, but sport X dot bet is gonna be a great place to look at all the code that they've been doing. Um they haven't designed the kind of automated market maker yet, which we obviously need for our platform to integrate with liquidity pools and the sports book, but they're going to, but what they do have is on change settlement that they're currently using and I think they're just gonna partner up, which I think is a good idea with the likes of chain link or a third party oracle data provider, feel how complex it is. Mhm. Um so dressed in, you know, so um I see that the solution is more focused on the main chain uh since it's a city forward personally for applications like sports betting, uh you know, having instant settlements as a very, you know, business business critical because you'll be making bets left and right, right, based on uh for example, in the game of cricket or football will be betting in terms of every what's going to happen in the next five minutes. Uh So that very specific time, smell is very important. So ah right, so in that case here, the approach is generally more linked to meta mosque and uh going were the main chain if I'm not correct, if I'm not mistaken. So, uh have you guys explored ongoing going on secondary solutions? Yeah, so I haven't, I mean, look, it's the competitive sport hexes on polygon or message. Um I think that would be from my c fantastic uh to to do something similar to that given the transaction costs are so low and the speed of so quick. So I don't this this platform just would not work on, I don't think would work on the main train at all at the time being because of just the transaction of these just being too expensive, correct. And and by the way another point is obviously it would be fantastic to have uh the smart contract re decentralized data feeds to determine the outcome of betting matches. But I think to begin with the most complicated thing that I see designing is going to be the interaction with the liquidity pool providers and the sports book, profit and loss and how that all matches together. So it's so it's to begin with I'm sure we can just take results feeds from eight providers and it doesn't necessarily have to be all on chain in that respect. You know like a lot of sports betting platforms they'll take and they'll like six, you know six or seven result feeds if that's betfair, if that's pinnacle if that's the BBC or however and then it will obviously rate them too how well they perform in terms of in terms of like reporting odds and that can all be off chain and the you know, T. G. Labs can really help with that. It's simply how you input that data into into the on chain settlement I guess. Okay, got it. Uh could you just elaborate a little bit more regarding the uh the pool that you mentioned? Yeah if I look at let's go. So the liquidity pool mechanics. So basically again this this this code is actually from SpaceX but it would be similar so in order to act as a calendar party in order for the platform to guarantee it pays out bets right, we need to show that the platform is well funded um and my model, it's funded by the community so you will deposit your stable coins in illiquidity pool with the promise that in the short term obviously you're going to get token emissions of the platform, But in the long term you are laying bets with a say it's a three over round. So it's a bit like I guess being the backer to bet 365 or lab Brooks as a shareholder. So you invest in U. S. D. C. And you hope that you're taking The pool itself right? We'll only have seen an exposure of one or any market and this pool logistics will be the counter party to all bets on the platform. Um, so it's pretty crucial that as you know, so many events can be outstanding. Which is why if you look at the code that sport tex has done, there's a delay in the withdrawal to make sure you don't front run it. And, and obviously this that there might be some, some difficulty when say people place bats which are months into the future. Um That's obviously one of the, one of the issues that needs to be sorted in terms of what distance count uh people get when they withdrawal. But yeah, I see it as basically being able to that is there to provide liquidity to the sports book to take people's bets and in return providing liquidity. Who are expected to make a profit over the long run based on the fact that we are providing odds with an over out like any bookmaker is uh okay. So for these uh, say the guys who want the token in the pool, uh you mentioned about the long term payout, is there any short term benefit for them? Oh, so the short that they're being paid out, everything is consistent and immediate, right? Um, but as I, as I would imagine a bookmaker doesn't doesn't make a perfectly average profit day by day. Um You know, if if the liquidity pool had $10 million dollars in it And it had $1 million $11 million. And so everyone in the pool would Going to make 10%. In reality, you know, you're going to be making three on turnover. So, so if the liquidity pool is taking A million dollars of bets, it's probably, you know, the pool is making $30,000 a day, on average of the long run, you see what I mean? So say a month, then it's making $900,000 a month, right? So the returns are always going to be innocent, but when you want to withdraw, you've obviously got to make sure that people don't withdraw when they see obviously odds changing. You know, and they see the fact that the sports book has laid a lot on Chelsea and suddenly Chelsea are winning. So let me withdraw liquidity tokens quickly. Now that's why you have to have this delay in withdrawal. Okay, got it. Got it honestly. Um Okay. Now can you just walk me through an example, for example, we have uh say that we have to users one and there is a live match that's ongoing, for example, charity versus Manchester United. Um and we see, let's look at bob and Alice again. So bob bet $50 on Manu and Alice bet $50 on Chelsea. So what's the process then? I'm looking to understand like what is our cut behind it? So as now in the pool there is $100 right? Uh No. So in that situation right? The pool is will be making some risk free returns, like any bookmaker hedging correctly words. So In order for Bob to have his $50 bet right, he has to know that the bookmaker has $50. And as a result of our liquidity pools we have the money to secure paying him out. Right now Alice comes to bet. The other way in turn, just the exposure of liquidity pool is almost dissipated because you know it's taken a bet on Chelsea has taken a bet on Liverpool. And I think in this situation obviously then we would also be wanting bats on the drawer. But if you say it was just a two sided market in the end, given that you're a bookmaker, you've hedged your liabilities and you've just made a percentage on on the odds, okay. You know, but in reality most bookmakers don't perfectly hedge you know their books to make a profit regardless of the outcome, because people tend to bet on short priced events, right? Um, and of course they will hopefully further down the line as well or at the beginning that will be functions to for the, for the liquidity pools to be able to hedge their exposure, stay with other platforms or other users. Um, but I don't want to complicated at this stage. I think what I'm trying to understand here is safe bob vince bob bets $50 and he wins. Right? So right now say he made around $75. Okay. According to the arts. And so are we taking a cut? As in the house always gets a cut, right? The house is a liquidity pool. Okay. So the card goes to the house goes to the liquidity liquidity pool. Yes. Although is that car mechanics like low, So for me right now, in terms of mechanics, the platform will take a small percentage on say turnover, right to run it. And also to incentivize people to own tech bets tokens Write a suggestion right now is that the platform charges not .5 on turnover. You'll just see that. And obviously the odds not being as good, it will be kind of will be incorporated into the odds. Now when, when obviously as this one's here says, you know, when you become the house, you know, you are making a profit of what the sports book makes. So, you know, bob wins, but Alice loses. But in the end there's, you know, bob bet 50. Alice spent 50 but she only 1 45 to spare $5 ends up in the Tiger book or say bob was the only person to bet and losers. The, whatever you want to call this pool. We're gonna change the name. But the liquidity pool is the one who benefits in the long run for just like it like it is the house, it is the sports book harder. Um, can uh, like now let's have a look at the entire app. Uh, as a whole, right? So as a customer, could you just elaborate on the customer's learning? Like is there a K. I see. And how is the onboarding like and things like that. So, I think a rich initially will be, um, will be licensing qsl, so the onboarding is fairly relaxed. Um, But I do want to have a simplify K. I. C. Process where state people, mm hmm. People can bet, to an extent anonymously. Like because I think you have to right now compete with other platforms are out there and they don't have a lot of K. Y. C. Um to go play on their platform. But what one can incorporate is if you want to bet over a certain level you need to you need to K. Y. C. Um At that at that point it's just really more of a like a regulatory issue um At the moment we're not entirely sure um if it's if it's if it's required to begin with um if people just can just connect their metal mask wallets and bet. Now obviously the issue with that is you have professional uh gamblers and syndicates out there. Um And so there needs to be some pretty good software to ensure that the platform can pick up on users who are trying to say circumnavigate limits or whether or not which we've been discussing with T. G. Labs is the platform operates a bit more like Asian bookmakers do whether there's a certain amount of liquidity at a certain price. And so when that equality is gone, the price changes. Okay. But you've got to, I mean, sorry God. Yeah, I have a question during, uh, you mentioned that, uh, you know, users to be able to get anonymously. So would you be considering, you know, they did the administration of loving for that reason or the candidates do the application? I said yes to set in place a bet anonymously. So I think you have to, you have to register register say with your message, mosque, register with your name and your email address. Um, which I think is fair enough in terms of going to the process of proving that is you, um, that will be done after a certain limit will be done in the guidelines of what curious tower the gaming license company wants. But I just can't, you know, it's pretty difficult to be a competitor right now. Um, if you're going through a huge amount of compliance when No one else is doing it. But I do believe that after a certain level, say it's a deposit of $5,000 or whatever it is that you need to be verified in the platform. And if obviously we raised quite amount of money we will want to, this will also, this will also be registered license and say the UK. Where of course you will need to have K ice to see an amL Yeah, I mean we launched a Carousel licensed product a couple of years ago. Um, certainly, you know, our guidance was that, you know, they could pretty much go in with a name and an email address you hit a certain limit or want to cash out. And that's when it starts getting complicated, like you see with the FX platforms, right? You know, you, you can, you can pretty much get in there, but if you want to get the money out, it becomes deposit a lot. Then it's when you start hitting that higher level. Yeah, but to be fair in this case the set the sellers is that you're never having to deposit on the platform? Yeah, exactly. So it'll be interesting to see what the licenses are. I think uh you know, I think I prefer to have as much ky CML as possible to ensure that people are using a platform for the wrong reasons or how, you know, a problem, gamblers being able to get on, but I wanted to be pretty simple and streamlined initially. Yeah. Have you, have you started just, I'm not don't want to attract too much conversation about flying. Have you you speaking to people and yourself to manage the licensing process at the moment? Yes. Okay. Uh, the thing is, I know it's pretty relaxed. It's just more about, it's more about what I'm saying would be comfortable with, I think personally running this platform. Yeah, absolutely, Absolutely. Okay. We had a very creative one that was very crypto friendly actually. So yeah, the issue is, is is whether or not sure us out and you have to guide them away from this idea that the liquidity pools are back in the platform, because ultimately, that's probably where the K Y C and AML issue is, you know, with all the liquidity pools, like, you know, if you're learning people like every platform does right now deposit in liquidity pool without checking the source of funds and then that source of funds being used to power the sports book. That's that's the only thing that the laws are working out right now as to how they can best phrase that. Mhm. Mhm. Um So what are the list of uh say we do have a metals continues tonight? So um uh what what all are the list of currencies that we're looking to support? So I think initially we're just looking to support betting in stable coins. Um So you're back, you know Exactly because I guess the problem is if you let people and this is something I guess more for you guys to see if it's possible but if you let people bet in different currency, you know ethereum and Bitcoin and stable coins, I'm just wondering it might be quite difficult for the sports book to be able to accurately hedge its risk as a liquidity pool. Be constantly have to be constant having to sell and buy. So I think initially it will be what stable coins does the platform want to support and host, which it believes are stable together so you're able to deposit, you know, Die usd, see US DT into the pool and potentially as well it would like you to be able to bet with a native currency, you know, tech backed tokens because users will be rewarded with tech backed tokens and hopefully is one of the other reason would be is that they can also, you bet with a token to but from my experience as a sports gambler, most people who use this platform won't really want to bet and some token that's going up and down value and have, you know, they they won't be interested in that. That would just be people maybe in the crypto community or just to have the option of that. But that is really fundamentally I want them to go to bed and stable coins only. Okay. But you know, you mentioned another thing about when users come to the platform, it's kind of having two interfaces here that work quite well together, you've got crypto users who are going to be very much used to kind of depositing in R. V. And compound, invest the finance, they will be wanting to deposit in a process very similar to those to get a return on their U. S. D. C. Or they're also depositing the token of the protocol. And then obviously you have users who are coming to the platform to Tibet and they're probably not that interested in depositing in liquidity pools or have any idea what a liquidity pool is. So it's so that's why it's crucial that kind of, we make a platform that is able to really appeal to uh you know, kind of native crypto community sports gamblers where they only have two, you know, you have a widget like say Moon Pay where they can deposit via their debit card to start betting on the platform because it goes debit card to die to, you know, onto the platform. An interesting note is that Sport X. Because they also operate on polygon, everything is obviously wraps and it's quite a complex procedure to kind of swap your die to your rap die and then and then unswayed pit. So it's just making sure that that process if we do use, you know, we have to use like a layer to solution is how do you simplify that process? So people don't get put off from wanting to pot to deposit because they don't understand what they're doing? Mhm. Mhm. Mhm Hello? I thought I did my did you hear the question of and I think there was some interference with the microphone there America Yes, you are. Okay. So I had asked. So based on what you mentioned, right, so you're looking to add constraints and rules on the platform as to enable uh just to define what people can do and what people cannot do in terms of transactions on the platform. I guess the constraints are is that, you know, there will be limits. Uh huh. The constraint the constraints are simply like the limits of how much someone is able to Tibet. But apart from that they want a huge amount of constraints, right? It's just like any other sports sports betting platform, you like the look of that market. Again, I'm designing this most of the people say outside of regulated territories who don't have access to trusted uh bookmakers. Um, and that's why, yeah, I was saying that not disturb the bed size, right? Say in terms of withdrawals, how exactly would withdrawals happening? Like, for example, so ideal? Well, you don't ever have to deposit and withdraw. All right. You want about that. When Chelsea you put $1000 in it 2 to 1, you submit the bets, you may have to prove that with your metal mask. Or of course, to make it simple for people who don't have metal mask, they have their wallet embedded in the platform. Um, but you're never depositing withdrawing, that's always your wallet. Whether or not you're using the platform s a mask and the outcome of of that smart contract is just determined by being fed information from the oracle data feed. That process. Obviously, I think is the most very difficult. So initially, you know initially I'm sure you can get away with doing a lot of this off chain. Um And maybe people do have to deposit but ideally I don't want people depositing or withdrawing. It's just after every every bad outcome. You know the contract says you know if Chelsea's for over 2.5 goals and it's been verified by all of these various oracle providers then we pay out that bet. Okay so it's the rules are already fine. Um Okay uh Have we planned anything regarding you know like God customer support within the so the customer support it will be a mixture of T. G. Labs provide. They provide two things either provide just the sports book itself or they also provide a lot of the support around that. Having said that, I doubt that their support will obviously be um well kind of kind of venture over to talking about how you can have wrapped and unwrapped tokens and mess mask. So it will need to be provided for. Yeah. Okay. Um now based on there are another thing is like most apps, right? Most betting apps, they have a policy regarding referrals, like use a referral from usually what they do is they just award up a bunch of tokens for referring a couple of users. So have we do we have something similar to that plant in here in the app? Sorry. In terms of rewarding people with the tokens? Yeah. Yeah. So we call that, that's the kind of on this one that's like bet mining rewards and that was after, you know, so initially it's quite simple, you know, for every pound you win, you win a percentage of the rewards that week. And with these rewards, you can then obviously go and steak these tokens in the staking pool. It will also give you further awards. Um, so, and, and, and this will be long term kind of paid for by the fact that the platform itself charges that fee between the users and liquidity pools when every bet is made, Which will go, you know, I think I've hear, I've put it, this is obviously changing. Um, but you know, initially, as I said, 25 of the 0 .5 turnover, we'll go into, uh, you know, rewards or those, those staking to incentivize. Okay, so, um, early point was I was asking about refering users as in referring a customer. Yeah. Right. So even that would be based off on top of this, Right? That would be the mining reward platform will be used to reward it. Was there you mean like referrals? Yeah. So yes. So I think the idea, like, like any, um, like any bookmaker, when you've got affiliates and referrals, uh, when when someone refers, went to a platform, they're going to be entitled to a percentage of of of the kind of wins and losses of a customer. Um Now it's difficult to see, well, initially, of course, the tokens that the allocation of the tokens, if we go down to here, say, and you've got, we've already got say, you know, um, this is to be changed, but you'll have a percentage of the token allocations that can go towards same marketing, which can cover affiliates for a number of years before the platform really decides how to how to reward affiliates as well. So it doesn't have to be natural natural growth as well for the platform to get to begin with. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But it be great to understand what your feedback is if you think, you know, Matic, you're probably going to be the right platform to build it on and and how and how how you could see this this process of the smart contracts working around market, which obviously, you know, if it has a lot of in play events, it's going to be pretty, pretty crucial to have fast settlement, correct? So Matic is uh it's scalable and uh we have worked on Matic before, so I do recommend using Magic because it will help with the uh the instant settlement of it's going to be very crucial for this, so yeah, definitely. Yes, another option I would suggest is uh having a ledger of yourself instead of depending on a public uh Blockchain, Maybe you could go the other direction and go something like uh hypothetical implementation where we can like just uh represent, say user a has x amount of funds in in just a hyperlocal. I know like innovation. Sorry, I haven't heard of that, but I'm I mean I'm all is as long as, as long as as long as the platform cannot, you know, not pay people out, that's the key thing, it can be, it's irrefutable if you win. I'm not for any solution here, but I don't quite understand how is he was saying? What I was saying is uh magic is fine, you can use it for instance settlements. But another way for like just to have settlements happen faster is like just owning the entire blocks in back in the council um by safe implementing it in high apology. Uh you can just have a ledger bed, it's a transaction ledger, for example, Bob has $50. Alice is $50 and that will basically represent their wallets and then bob can make a bet on Chelsea and all of that. Since it's a high pleasure note that we own transactions can be whatever we uh basically the speed will depend on the compute power of the ec. Two instance that we deploy it on. Okay, that's one approach, that's one out of the box, the person I've seen people do this, but uh the right way to go ahead again. Uh It's the magic implementation. Uh Yeah, so we see the right the right. What would go ahead? The right way is a magic implementation. Yeah. And you know, if a lot of the stuff that the smart contract of marriage reading off chain initially until everything becomes scalable and that's completely fine. Right? So but I think it be great if people had decided that had had the belief to begin with that when they bet, you know, they don't need to deposit their funds, the funds get transmitted um on message. And maybe from our end, obviously we control initially how that contract pays it out to ensure that while we're designing it and um, it's accurate because the last thing you want is someone to better sizable sum of money and and the code not work so well and then pay them out if it's lost, etcetera to begin with. But again, uh I think the obvious uh drawback of Matic would be um high gas free because ultimately it is based on on it's built on top of ethereum, it's it's second layer on ethereum. So ultimately, you might have to end up paying a ghastly when the settlement is, you know, like completed on the chain. So, oh, you mean withdrawing it back onto the ethereum network? Yeah. So yes, yeah, brought back. But we'll see what can be done. I think you're right. But if if in terms of a process of timing, you know, each scales in the next year or so or six months, then you hope hopefully those fees obviously significantly diminished. Because I mean the message the right now is absolutely nothing per transaction. I mean it's definitely a cost that can be absorbed. If someone's, the minimum bet on the platform is say $10. Mm hmm. Uh you know, then then I'm sure it can cover the north, you know the half of sense transaction cream. But you're right, depositing automatic will cost users right now You're right like $40 and then withdrawing more costs an amount. So that yeah, that could make it. But then you see, I guess you have to hope that you're designing on the fact that a theory Mark is solving those problems out. Hopefully they will solve that problem in a couple of months. We'll see. Yeah, so maybe it's best to kind of yeah, to focus on if message is a good solution, unless you unless you really think that the solution is better um to build on something one of those layer two solutions where where we can actually make it properly decentralized. Okay, got it. Um anyway I'll take a look at a couple of others that solution providers and uh try to get back to you if I if I get something that you do look at, you look at SpaceX dot bat because they really do look at SpaceX dot net because they are based on the message and they are almost trying to do the exact equivalent of what they're already doing it, but there in exchange rather than the sports book, but everything they're settling is on on message. Okay, interesting. So basically, we're trying to build the platform similar to spot extra bed. Exactly. But rather than being an exchange is a sports book. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. Spartacus, correct me if I'm wrong, they do look like sports book, Right? No, it's an exchange. So rather than being a house Alice and bob placed their orders on the marketplace. So it's like, if you've heard of Betfair versus that 365 ones in exchange and one's a sports book. Mhm. Okay. And I asked what it is, you know, the past deposits and then to access it, sorry, like an extent, uh, cortex, I believe it has the deposits and withdrawals. Right? And we are not looking into that. So I think they do have deposited with drawers because I think ultimately obviously it's making it cheaper to avoid the gas fees. Um I'm not obviously against that in the short term for people to have to deposit but I think in the long term be much better if people don't have to. Mhm interesting. I'll take a look at spot checks. I guess the crucial thing is if if hopefully you guys are working alongside the company T. G. Labs they really will be doing everything to do with how a typical sports book is obviously designed and works and and it will just be it would just really be like how we can in this kind of short and medium term integrate that with crypto settlement and integrate that with liquidity pools and making sure that they're streaming together. Okay. Um I see. What exactly read. Could you just scroll left on your sigma blink like staking three point. Mhm. The slightly speaking. Oh staking. Yeah, this one, could you just explain that? Uh Sorry? So yeah, sorry, so this I haven't I haven't finished um but staking is it's just like any other uh kind of launch right now you are able to deposit or you can stake your tech back tokens, right? And rather than having say the higher returns and higher risk from staking your stable coins to act as a counter party, you're staking will earn you a percentage of the turnover at the platform, charges the liquidity pools and the users. Okay. And of course you'll be rewarded in the tokens of the platform. Um And as a result obviously, you know, you get to have governance of the platform to okay, so it's you know, it's just another feature of I guess it was like the standard defy model of people staking to add more of those tokens, but also to own more of the ownership in the long run, they'll have to say of what the plant weather platform goes, whether or not, you know, you decide, you know, if it has a casino or bingo, et cetera. Yeah. Okay, so you would be opening uh something similar to a board meeting and where people would actually be depending on their state's in the platform, uh They would be able to walk on particular feature requests and things like that. Absolutely, yes. So they can vote on, they can they can vote on on almost all masses, I guess eventually of what they want, what they want out of the platform. Okay. And what markets are my offer, whether or not, You know, uh the liquidity pools or, you know, the odds provided work on a two margin or a three margin. you know, in that sense? Um But yeah, so see it, like if you if you if you took a traditional model of, I guess in exchange and exchange makes money based on a percentage of the profits of the winning bets. A sports book obviously makes money on the fact that in the long run they win in this model, I'm just saying the profits share is somewhat split because the platform needs funds to run itself, and profits also need to go to liquidity providers to, but not all the profits of all the bats go to liquidity providers, otherwise, you know, how do you run the platform? How does that platform grow? It may not just provide, you know, it's just, it's good to know, it's it's almost like investing in, You know, investing in a sports book, you're not going to get 100 of the profits. So that's my solution that there's a small percentage charge on turnover that goes to the platform and those who stake the token and also incentivize people to state the token. Yeah. Okay, garlic. Mhm. Yeah. So that's it from me guys or Adam around. Um Are there any questions from you guys? No uh done for me at the moment. Have we got everything we need to be able to produce the next documentation. Um Are there any other questions from anyone? Yeah, I believe we did capture the ancient set of requirements and I'll sit down with paranoia and uh, you know, I'm not about so that we can come up back there uh concept. And the depression document, is that right now? The one is a great, great more forward. Yeah. Let's let's have an internal catsup on this along with Christina and Adam after this car. Uh Adam can adam can let uh I didn't know about the next uh call and and the following following steps. Yeah absolutely we'll go offline and have an internal conversation with George and Daniel. I'll catch up with you with next steps and very soon and we can take from there but absolute pleasure drilling into this. I mean you know it's very very cool. It's just it's just I just I just hope you know any questions or worries about like I think that's why it would have been good to send this recording on and get T. G. Labs have an input um when anything like sports betting related you guys are coming up and going on you know how how does this fit? Um You know hopefully they will be there to to answer those questions. Yeah yeah we will share the recording so they will get as soon as it's rendered, but as you mentioned, you know, you said, you guys have experienced in building liquidity kind of pause before right. So yeah, we've got, we've got, we've got some good defy experience, we spent a lot of time sort of looking at stuff like that, building things. So yeah, you know, that's that, that, that part of the solution that we can bring for sure, Great. And I guess as much code as you can already use us out there, whether or not that sport texas or anything, you know, I'm actually five of that um, in terms of like time saving of how it all works, so yeah, absolutely. Okay, well, we, we know our next steps and only as with you guys are flying about the next steps from, from our side, but it's been an absolute pleasure connecting with you today and learning more and, you know, hearing it straight from, from, from, from the founders mouth is always very good. And yeah, absolutely, we'll look back with any other questions we have. So leave us to spend some time discussing internally and obviously we've got a group open so I can, I can act as a point of contact for any other questions that you might, we might have, but I think we're good for now, so we'll let you get on with your day. We were banging guys. We were only five minutes over and that's good. Okay, thanks a lot. Thank you. Thanks guys. Uh, can you just stop recording now? Thank you.\"}]"

Sure, Okay, just so we\\'re really pleased to introduce Daniel and George to, to the team here, We\\'ve got the right representation of technical people to capture your requirements today and obviously see how we proceed from there. Um What we\\'re gonna do is is very much hand over to you for this meeting and you can talk us through the vision um and the depth that you shared with us ahead of the meeting, which has been shared internally from there, we\\'re going to, this can be driven by paranoia, who\\'s on the call. Um and then we\\'re going to, we\\'re going to just listen intently. We may come back with a few questions. Um and we\\'ll take from there now the school is recording. So if you\\'d like to start an introduction and you can make a brief introduction jewels to yourself and fantastic products. Yeah, so I\\'m creating a, hopefully creating a decentralized sports book that is, as you know, from the white paper backed off the liquidity pools in the crypto crypto what defy sphere? Um I think the biggest problems, obviously, I think that we\\'re going to have is making sure that it\\'s built on the Blockchain that\\'s going to be able to handle um this kind of uh, the amount of processes involved from start to finish. Um you know, we\\'ve got a long term vision is to have decentralized data feeds feeding into the platform that obviously then we have a we have the whole bet process being in escrow, No 1\\'s ever deposited on the platform. Um, so I mean if I don\\'t know if I can share my share my screen on this. Yeah, you\\'ve got sharing sharing rights. Let me know if you can see the icon. Oh yeah, sorry, that\\'s it. Um, host disabled participant screen chang. I\\'m really very sorry about that. Mm hmm. Adam you\\'re about to host a terrible house. Uh mm I\\'m gonna make christian. I\\'m gonna make you host and just see if you can change those settings from your side. It\\'s that I thought would be quite good just to bring up the protocol. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you should have had right so much to what\\'s happening with the settings. So that\\'s my around. Apologize for that. Uh can you are you able chris could you just make George co host for a second? I am trying to do that. Give me a minute. Daniels. Co host. That was why I clicked the wrong person. So that\\'s my story. Okay, right, I\\'m nearly there share screen hosts disabled participants. Still, if you make a joke. Yeah, you can make uh daniel and also joe directly because uh can you just make sure? Yeah. Sorry, let me just uh allow all participants to share. Okay. Yeah they will be able to do it now. Perfect. That should be working. Uh huh. Mhm. Uh There you go. Do you know what it\\'s not gonna let me do on my laptop actually just got your laptop. So I\\'ll just say if you read the white paper and stuff obviously running through it um potential let me just try one more time. Do you want us to pull out the white paper? There we go. We\\'re sharing. So as you can see obviously like a typical sports book uh feeds in uh you know feed him through a piece or the data to provide customers to bet with. And obviously we\\'re just trying to bring in the process here to make it go on Shane for as much as possible Now unfortunately T. G. Labs couldn\\'t join in this core but this company obviously specializes in providing sports betting solutions as you sure. You know, it\\'s just pretty complex to be designing that all from scratch given the amount of markets and you know they\\'re just established and it\\'s much easier to come to market with a product that can be ready in a month. And they\\'ve obviously mentioned that they\\'re happy to work with you guys too to design this flow. So obviously a traditional bookmaker doesn\\'t have a decentralized data in. But for me this isn\\'t the most important part to begin with. This would be great to have in the long term. The most important part is when you go to accept and you click the bats, it\\'s going to be integrated with a mess a mask and that bet is recorded to be on chain and a oracle data feed is the only source to determine the outcome of that bet if you guys follow. Um So yeah, so that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s for me that\\'s the process which is going to be the most difficult handling all these back transactions. Of course, when someone might want to cash out a bet that will have to interact again when uh the liquidity pools obviously taking the risk of all these bets and then when you want to withdraw and deposit from a liquidity pool, they\\'re going to have to take up to date feeds of the liability and exposure of of the platform if you see what I\\'m saying. Um So yeah, I guess for me from that perspective that\\'s what I find is gonna be the hardest part to, to design, but I\\'m sure everything\\'s possible and I know how to my mentions before, but sport X dot bet is gonna be a great place to look at all the code that they\\'ve been doing. Um they haven\\'t designed the kind of automated market maker yet, which we obviously need for our platform to integrate with liquidity pools and the sports book, but they\\'re going to, but what they do have is on change settlement that they\\'re currently using and I think they\\'re just gonna partner up, which I think is a good idea with the likes of chain link or a third party oracle data provider, feel how complex it is. Mhm. Um so dressed in, you know, so um I see that the solution is more focused on the main chain uh since it\\'s a city forward personally for applications like sports betting, uh you know, having instant settlements as a very, you know, business business critical because you\\'ll be making bets left and right, right, based on uh for example, in the game of cricket or football will be betting in terms of every what\\'s going to happen in the next five minutes. Uh So that very specific time, smell is very important. So ah right, so in that case here, the approach is generally more linked to meta mosque and uh going were the main chain if I\\'m not correct, if I\\'m not mistaken. So, uh have you guys explored ongoing going on secondary solutions? Yeah, so I haven\\'t, I mean, look, it\\'s the competitive sport hexes on polygon or message. Um I think that would be from my c fantastic uh to to do something similar to that given the transaction costs are so low and the speed of so quick. So I don\\'t this this platform just would not work on, I don\\'t think would work on the main train at all at the time being because of just the transaction of these just being too expensive, correct. And and by the way another point is obviously it would be fantastic to have uh the smart contract re decentralized data feeds to determine the outcome of betting matches. But I think to begin with the most complicated thing that I see designing is going to be the interaction with the liquidity pool providers and the sports book, profit and loss and how that all matches together. So it\\'s so it\\'s to begin with I\\'m sure we can just take results feeds from eight providers and it doesn\\'t necessarily have to be all on chain in that respect. You know like a lot of sports betting platforms they\\'ll take and they\\'ll like six, you know six or seven result feeds if that\\'s betfair, if that\\'s pinnacle if that\\'s the BBC or however and then it will obviously rate them too how well they perform in terms of in terms of like reporting odds and that can all be off chain and the you know, T. G. Labs can really help with that. It\\'s simply how you input that data into into the on chain settlement I guess. Okay, got it. Uh could you just elaborate a little bit more regarding the uh the pool that you mentioned? Yeah if I look at let\\'s go. So the liquidity pool mechanics. So basically again this this this code is actually from SpaceX but it would be similar so in order to act as a calendar party in order for the platform to guarantee it pays out bets right, we need to show that the platform is well funded um and my model, it\\'s funded by the community so you will deposit your stable coins in illiquidity pool with the promise that in the short term obviously you\\'re going to get token emissions of the platform, But in the long term you are laying bets with a say it\\'s a three over round. So it\\'s a bit like I guess being the backer to bet 365 or lab Brooks as a shareholder. So you invest in U. S. D. C. And you hope that you\\'re taking The pool itself right? We\\'ll only have seen an exposure of one or any market and this pool logistics will be the counter party to all bets on the platform. Um, so it\\'s pretty crucial that as you know, so many events can be outstanding. Which is why if you look at the code that sport tex has done, there\\'s a delay in the withdrawal to make sure you don\\'t front run it. And, and obviously this that there might be some, some difficulty when say people place bats which are months into the future. Um That\\'s obviously one of the, one of the issues that needs to be sorted in terms of what distance count uh people get when they withdrawal. But yeah, I see it as basically being able to that is there to provide liquidity to the sports book to take people\\'s bets and in return providing liquidity. Who are expected to make a profit over the long run based on the fact that we are providing odds with an over out like any bookmaker is uh okay. So for these uh, say the guys who want the token in the pool, uh you mentioned about the long term payout, is there any short term benefit for them? Oh, so the short that they\\'re being paid out, everything is consistent and immediate, right? Um, but as I, as I would imagine a bookmaker doesn\\'t doesn\\'t make a perfectly average profit day by day. Um You know, if if the liquidity pool had $10 million dollars in it And it had $1 million $11 million. And so everyone in the pool would Going to make 10%. In reality, you know, you\\'re going to be making three on turnover. So, so if the liquidity pool is taking A million dollars of bets, it\\'s probably, you know, the pool is making $30,000 a day, on average of the long run, you see what I mean? So say a month, then it\\'s making $900,000 a month, right? So the returns are always going to be innocent, but when you want to withdraw, you\\'ve obviously got to make sure that people don\\'t withdraw when they see obviously odds changing. You know, and they see the fact that the sports book has laid a lot on Chelsea and suddenly Chelsea are winning. So let me withdraw liquidity tokens quickly. Now that\\'s why you have to have this delay in withdrawal. Okay, got it. Got it honestly. Um Okay. Now can you just walk me through an example, for example, we have uh say that we have to users one and there is a live match that\\'s ongoing, for example, charity versus Manchester United. Um and we see, let\\'s look at bob and Alice again. So bob bet $50 on Manu and Alice bet $50 on Chelsea. So what\\'s the process then? I\\'m looking to understand like what is our cut behind it? So as now in the pool there is $100 right? Uh No. So in that situation right? The pool is will be making some risk free returns, like any bookmaker hedging correctly words. So In order for Bob to have his $50 bet right, he has to know that the bookmaker has $50. And as a result of our liquidity pools we have the money to secure paying him out. Right now Alice comes to bet. The other way in turn, just the exposure of liquidity pool is almost dissipated because you know it\\'s taken a bet on Chelsea has taken a bet on Liverpool. And I think in this situation obviously then we would also be wanting bats on the drawer. But if you say it was just a two sided market in the end, given that you\\'re a bookmaker, you\\'ve hedged your liabilities and you\\'ve just made a percentage on on the odds, okay. You know, but in reality most bookmakers don\\'t perfectly hedge you know their books to make a profit regardless of the outcome, because people tend to bet on short priced events, right? Um, and of course they will hopefully further down the line as well or at the beginning that will be functions to for the, for the liquidity pools to be able to hedge their exposure, stay with other platforms or other users. Um, but I don\\'t want to complicated at this stage. I think what I\\'m trying to understand here is safe bob vince bob bets $50 and he wins. Right? So right now say he made around $75. Okay. According to the arts. And so are we taking a cut? As in the house always gets a cut, right? The house is a liquidity pool. Okay. So the card goes to the house goes to the liquidity liquidity pool. Yes. Although is that car mechanics like low, So for me right now, in terms of mechanics, the platform will take a small percentage on say turnover, right to run it. And also to incentivize people to own tech bets tokens Write a suggestion right now is that the platform charges not .5 on turnover. You\\'ll just see that. And obviously the odds not being as good, it will be kind of will be incorporated into the odds. Now when, when obviously as this one\\'s here says, you know, when you become the house, you know, you are making a profit of what the sports book makes. So, you know, bob wins, but Alice loses. But in the end there\\'s, you know, bob bet 50. Alice spent 50 but she only 1 45 to spare $5 ends up in the Tiger book or say bob was the only person to bet and losers. The, whatever you want to call this pool. We\\'re gonna change the name. But the liquidity pool is the one who benefits in the long run for just like it like it is the house, it is the sports book harder. Um, can uh, like now let\\'s have a look at the entire app. Uh, as a whole, right? So as a customer, could you just elaborate on the customer\\'s learning? Like is there a K. I see. And how is the onboarding like and things like that. So, I think a rich initially will be, um, will be licensing qsl, so the onboarding is fairly relaxed. Um, But I do want to have a simplify K. I. C. Process where state people, mm hmm. People can bet, to an extent anonymously. Like because I think you have to right now compete with other platforms are out there and they don\\'t have a lot of K. Y. C. Um to go play on their platform. But what one can incorporate is if you want to bet over a certain level you need to you need to K. Y. C. Um At that at that point it\\'s just really more of a like a regulatory issue um At the moment we\\'re not entirely sure um if it\\'s if it\\'s if it\\'s required to begin with um if people just can just connect their metal mask wallets and bet. Now obviously the issue with that is you have professional uh gamblers and syndicates out there. Um And so there needs to be some pretty good software to ensure that the platform can pick up on users who are trying to say circumnavigate limits or whether or not which we\\'ve been discussing with T. G. Labs is the platform operates a bit more like Asian bookmakers do whether there\\'s a certain amount of liquidity at a certain price. And so when that equality is gone, the price changes. Okay. But you\\'ve got to, I mean, sorry God. Yeah, I have a question during, uh, you mentioned that, uh, you know, users to be able to get anonymously. So would you be considering, you know, they did the administration of loving for that reason or the candidates do the application? I said yes to set in place a bet anonymously. So I think you have to, you have to register register say with your message, mosque, register with your name and your email address. Um, which I think is fair enough in terms of going to the process of proving that is you, um, that will be done after a certain limit will be done in the guidelines of what curious tower the gaming license company wants. But I just can\\'t, you know, it\\'s pretty difficult to be a competitor right now. Um, if you\\'re going through a huge amount of compliance when No one else is doing it. But I do believe that after a certain level, say it\\'s a deposit of $5,000 or whatever it is that you need to be verified in the platform. And if obviously we raised quite amount of money we will want to, this will also, this will also be registered license and say the UK. Where of course you will need to have K ice to see an amL Yeah, I mean we launched a Carousel licensed product a couple of years ago. Um, certainly, you know, our guidance was that, you know, they could pretty much go in with a name and an email address you hit a certain limit or want to cash out. And that\\'s when it starts getting complicated, like you see with the FX platforms, right? You know, you, you can, you can pretty much get in there, but if you want to get the money out, it becomes deposit a lot. Then it\\'s when you start hitting that higher level. Yeah, but to be fair in this case the set the sellers is that you\\'re never having to deposit on the platform? Yeah, exactly. So it\\'ll be interesting to see what the licenses are. I think uh you know, I think I prefer to have as much ky CML as possible to ensure that people are using a platform for the wrong reasons or how, you know, a problem, gamblers being able to get on, but I wanted to be pretty simple and streamlined initially. Yeah. Have you, have you started just, I\\'m not don\\'t want to attract too much conversation about flying. Have you you speaking to people and yourself to manage the licensing process at the moment? Yes. Okay. Uh, the thing is, I know it\\'s pretty relaxed. It\\'s just more about, it\\'s more about what I\\'m saying would be comfortable with, I think personally running this platform. Yeah, absolutely, Absolutely. Okay. We had a very creative one that was very crypto friendly actually. So yeah, the issue is, is is whether or not sure us out and you have to guide them away from this idea that the liquidity pools are back in the platform, because ultimately, that\\'s probably where the K Y C and AML issue is, you know, with all the liquidity pools, like, you know, if you\\'re learning people like every platform does right now deposit in liquidity pool without checking the source of funds and then that source of funds being used to power the sports book. That\\'s that\\'s the only thing that the laws are working out right now as to how they can best phrase that. Mhm. Mhm. Um So what are the list of uh say we do have a metals continues tonight? So um uh what what all are the list of currencies that we\\'re looking to support? So I think initially we\\'re just looking to support betting in stable coins. Um So you\\'re back, you know Exactly because I guess the problem is if you let people and this is something I guess more for you guys to see if it\\'s possible but if you let people bet in different currency, you know ethereum and Bitcoin and stable coins, I\\'m just wondering it might be quite difficult for the sports book to be able to accurately hedge its risk as a liquidity pool. Be constantly have to be constant having to sell and buy. So I think initially it will be what stable coins does the platform want to support and host, which it believes are stable together so you\\'re able to deposit, you know, Die usd, see US DT into the pool and potentially as well it would like you to be able to bet with a native currency, you know, tech backed tokens because users will be rewarded with tech backed tokens and hopefully is one of the other reason would be is that they can also, you bet with a token to but from my experience as a sports gambler, most people who use this platform won\\'t really want to bet and some token that\\'s going up and down value and have, you know, they they won\\'t be interested in that. That would just be people maybe in the crypto community or just to have the option of that. But that is really fundamentally I want them to go to bed and stable coins only. Okay. But you know, you mentioned another thing about when users come to the platform, it\\'s kind of having two interfaces here that work quite well together, you\\'ve got crypto users who are going to be very much used to kind of depositing in R. V. And compound, invest the finance, they will be wanting to deposit in a process very similar to those to get a return on their U. S. D. C. Or they\\'re also depositing the token of the protocol. And then obviously you have users who are coming to the platform to Tibet and they\\'re probably not that interested in depositing in liquidity pools or have any idea what a liquidity pool is. So it\\'s so that\\'s why it\\'s crucial that kind of, we make a platform that is able to really appeal to uh you know, kind of native crypto community sports gamblers where they only have two, you know, you have a widget like say Moon Pay where they can deposit via their debit card to start betting on the platform because it goes debit card to die to, you know, onto the platform. An interesting note is that Sport X. Because they also operate on polygon, everything is obviously wraps and it\\'s quite a complex procedure to kind of swap your die to your rap die and then and then unswayed pit. So it\\'s just making sure that that process if we do use, you know, we have to use like a layer to solution is how do you simplify that process? So people don\\'t get put off from wanting to pot to deposit because they don\\'t understand what they\\'re doing? Mhm. Mhm. Mhm Hello? I thought I did my did you hear the question of and I think there was some interference with the microphone there America Yes, you are. Okay. So I had asked. So based on what you mentioned, right, so you\\'re looking to add constraints and rules on the platform as to enable uh just to define what people can do and what people cannot do in terms of transactions on the platform. I guess the constraints are is that, you know, there will be limits. Uh huh. The constraint the constraints are simply like the limits of how much someone is able to Tibet. But apart from that they want a huge amount of constraints, right? It\\'s just like any other sports sports betting platform, you like the look of that market. Again, I\\'m designing this most of the people say outside of regulated territories who don\\'t have access to trusted uh bookmakers. Um, and that\\'s why, yeah, I was saying that not disturb the bed size, right? Say in terms of withdrawals, how exactly would withdrawals happening? Like, for example, so ideal? Well, you don\\'t ever have to deposit and withdraw. All right. You want about that. When Chelsea you put $1000 in it 2 to 1, you submit the bets, you may have to prove that with your metal mask. Or of course, to make it simple for people who don\\'t have metal mask, they have their wallet embedded in the platform. Um, but you\\'re never depositing withdrawing, that\\'s always your wallet. Whether or not you\\'re using the platform s a mask and the outcome of of that smart contract is just determined by being fed information from the oracle data feed. That process. Obviously, I think is the most very difficult. So initially, you know initially I\\'m sure you can get away with doing a lot of this off chain. Um And maybe people do have to deposit but ideally I don\\'t want people depositing or withdrawing. It\\'s just after every every bad outcome. You know the contract says you know if Chelsea\\'s for over 2.5 goals and it\\'s been verified by all of these various oracle providers then we pay out that bet. Okay so it\\'s the rules are already fine. Um Okay uh Have we planned anything regarding you know like God customer support within the so the customer support it will be a mixture of T. G. Labs provide. They provide two things either provide just the sports book itself or they also provide a lot of the support around that. Having said that, I doubt that their support will obviously be um well kind of kind of venture over to talking about how you can have wrapped and unwrapped tokens and mess mask. So it will need to be provided for. Yeah. Okay. Um now based on there are another thing is like most apps, right? Most betting apps, they have a policy regarding referrals, like use a referral from usually what they do is they just award up a bunch of tokens for referring a couple of users. So have we do we have something similar to that plant in here in the app? Sorry. In terms of rewarding people with the tokens? Yeah. Yeah. So we call that, that\\'s the kind of on this one that\\'s like bet mining rewards and that was after, you know, so initially it\\'s quite simple, you know, for every pound you win, you win a percentage of the rewards that week. And with these rewards, you can then obviously go and steak these tokens in the staking pool. It will also give you further awards. Um, so, and, and, and this will be long term kind of paid for by the fact that the platform itself charges that fee between the users and liquidity pools when every bet is made, Which will go, you know, I think I\\'ve hear, I\\'ve put it, this is obviously changing. Um, but you know, initially, as I said, 25 of the 0 .5 turnover, we\\'ll go into, uh, you know, rewards or those, those staking to incentivize. Okay, so, um, early point was I was asking about refering users as in referring a customer. Yeah. Right. So even that would be based off on top of this, Right? That would be the mining reward platform will be used to reward it. Was there you mean like referrals? Yeah. So yes. So I think the idea, like, like any, um, like any bookmaker, when you\\'ve got affiliates and referrals, uh, when when someone refers, went to a platform, they\\'re going to be entitled to a percentage of of of the kind of wins and losses of a customer. Um Now it\\'s difficult to see, well, initially, of course, the tokens that the allocation of the tokens, if we go down to here, say, and you\\'ve got, we\\'ve already got say, you know, um, this is to be changed, but you\\'ll have a percentage of the token allocations that can go towards same marketing, which can cover affiliates for a number of years before the platform really decides how to how to reward affiliates as well. So it doesn\\'t have to be natural natural growth as well for the platform to get to begin with. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But it be great to understand what your feedback is if you think, you know, Matic, you\\'re probably going to be the right platform to build it on and and how and how how you could see this this process of the smart contracts working around market, which obviously, you know, if it has a lot of in play events, it\\'s going to be pretty, pretty crucial to have fast settlement, correct? So Matic is uh it\\'s scalable and uh we have worked on Matic before, so I do recommend using Magic because it will help with the uh the instant settlement of it\\'s going to be very crucial for this, so yeah, definitely. Yes, another option I would suggest is uh having a ledger of yourself instead of depending on a public uh Blockchain, Maybe you could go the other direction and go something like uh hypothetical implementation where we can like just uh represent, say user a has x amount of funds in in just a hyperlocal. I know like innovation. Sorry, I haven\\'t heard of that, but I\\'m I mean I\\'m all is as long as, as long as as long as the platform cannot, you know, not pay people out, that\\'s the key thing, it can be, it\\'s irrefutable if you win. I\\'m not for any solution here, but I don\\'t quite understand how is he was saying? What I was saying is uh magic is fine, you can use it for instance settlements. But another way for like just to have settlements happen faster is like just owning the entire blocks in back in the council um by safe implementing it in high apology. Uh you can just have a ledger bed, it\\'s a transaction ledger, for example, Bob has $50. Alice is $50 and that will basically represent their wallets and then bob can make a bet on Chelsea and all of that. Since it\\'s a high pleasure note that we own transactions can be whatever we uh basically the speed will depend on the compute power of the ec. Two instance that we deploy it on. Okay, that\\'s one approach, that\\'s one out of the box, the person I\\'ve seen people do this, but uh the right way to go ahead again. Uh It\\'s the magic implementation. Uh Yeah, so we see the right the right. What would go ahead? The right way is a magic implementation. Yeah. And you know, if a lot of the stuff that the smart contract of marriage reading off chain initially until everything becomes scalable and that\\'s completely fine. Right? So but I think it be great if people had decided that had had the belief to begin with that when they bet, you know, they don\\'t need to deposit their funds, the funds get transmitted um on message. And maybe from our end, obviously we control initially how that contract pays it out to ensure that while we\\'re designing it and um, it\\'s accurate because the last thing you want is someone to better sizable sum of money and and the code not work so well and then pay them out if it\\'s lost, etcetera to begin with. But again, uh I think the obvious uh drawback of Matic would be um high gas free because ultimately it is based on on it\\'s built on top of ethereum, it\\'s it\\'s second layer on ethereum. So ultimately, you might have to end up paying a ghastly when the settlement is, you know, like completed on the chain. So, oh, you mean withdrawing it back onto the ethereum network? Yeah. So yes, yeah, brought back. But we\\'ll see what can be done. I think you\\'re right. But if if in terms of a process of timing, you know, each scales in the next year or so or six months, then you hope hopefully those fees obviously significantly diminished. Because I mean the message the right now is absolutely nothing per transaction. I mean it\\'s definitely a cost that can be absorbed. If someone\\'s, the minimum bet on the platform is say $10. Mm hmm. Uh you know, then then I\\'m sure it can cover the north, you know the half of sense transaction cream. But you\\'re right, depositing automatic will cost users right now You\\'re right like $40 and then withdrawing more costs an amount. So that yeah, that could make it. But then you see, I guess you have to hope that you\\'re designing on the fact that a theory Mark is solving those problems out. Hopefully they will solve that problem in a couple of months. We\\'ll see. Yeah, so maybe it\\'s best to kind of yeah, to focus on if message is a good solution, unless you unless you really think that the solution is better um to build on something one of those layer two solutions where where we can actually make it properly decentralized. Okay, got it. Um anyway I\\'ll take a look at a couple of others that solution providers and uh try to get back to you if I if I get something that you do look at, you look at SpaceX dot bat because they really do look at SpaceX dot net because they are based on the message and they are almost trying to do the exact equivalent of what they\\'re already doing it, but there in exchange rather than the sports book, but everything they\\'re settling is on on message. Okay, interesting. So basically, we\\'re trying to build the platform similar to spot extra bed. Exactly. But rather than being an exchange is a sports book. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. Spartacus, correct me if I\\'m wrong, they do look like sports book, Right? No, it\\'s an exchange. So rather than being a house Alice and bob placed their orders on the marketplace. So it\\'s like, if you\\'ve heard of Betfair versus that 365 ones in exchange and one\\'s a sports book. Mhm. Okay. And I asked what it is, you know, the past deposits and then to access it, sorry, like an extent, uh, cortex, I believe it has the deposits and withdrawals. Right? And we are not looking into that. So I think they do have deposited with drawers because I think ultimately obviously it\\'s making it cheaper to avoid the gas fees. Um I\\'m not obviously against that in the short term for people to have to deposit but I think in the long term be much better if people don\\'t have to. Mhm interesting. I\\'ll take a look at spot checks. I guess the crucial thing is if if hopefully you guys are working alongside the company T. G. Labs they really will be doing everything to do with how a typical sports book is obviously designed and works and and it will just be it would just really be like how we can in this kind of short and medium term integrate that with crypto settlement and integrate that with liquidity pools and making sure that they\\'re streaming together. Okay. Um I see. What exactly read. Could you just scroll left on your sigma blink like staking three point. Mhm. The slightly speaking. Oh staking. Yeah, this one, could you just explain that? Uh Sorry? So yeah, sorry, so this I haven\\'t I haven\\'t finished um but staking is it\\'s just like any other uh kind of launch right now you are able to deposit or you can stake your tech back tokens, right? And rather than having say the higher returns and higher risk from staking your stable coins to act as a counter party, you\\'re staking will earn you a percentage of the turnover at the platform, charges the liquidity pools and the users. Okay. And of course you\\'ll be rewarded in the tokens of the platform. Um And as a result obviously, you know, you get to have governance of the platform to okay, so it\\'s you know, it\\'s just another feature of I guess it was like the standard defy model of people staking to add more of those tokens, but also to own more of the ownership in the long run, they\\'ll have to say of what the plant weather platform goes, whether or not, you know, you decide, you know, if it has a casino or bingo, et cetera. Yeah. Okay, so you would be opening uh something similar to a board meeting and where people would actually be depending on their state\\'s in the platform, uh They would be able to walk on particular feature requests and things like that. Absolutely, yes. So they can vote on, they can they can vote on on almost all masses, I guess eventually of what they want, what they want out of the platform. Okay. And what markets are my offer, whether or not, You know, uh the liquidity pools or, you know, the odds provided work on a two margin or a three margin. you know, in that sense? Um But yeah, so see it, like if you if you if you took a traditional model of, I guess in exchange and exchange makes money based on a percentage of the profits of the winning bets. A sports book obviously makes money on the fact that in the long run they win in this model, I\\'m just saying the profits share is somewhat split because the platform needs funds to run itself, and profits also need to go to liquidity providers to, but not all the profits of all the bats go to liquidity providers, otherwise, you know, how do you run the platform? How does that platform grow? It may not just provide, you know, it\\'s just, it\\'s good to know, it\\'s it\\'s almost like investing in, You know, investing in a sports book, you\\'re not going to get 100 of the profits. So that\\'s my solution that there\\'s a small percentage charge on turnover that goes to the platform and those who stake the token and also incentivize people to state the token. Yeah. Okay, garlic. Mhm. Yeah. So that\\'s it from me guys or Adam around. Um Are there any questions from you guys? No uh done for me at the moment. Have we got everything we need to be able to produce the next documentation. Um Are there any other questions from anyone? Yeah, I believe we did capture the ancient set of requirements and I\\'ll sit down with paranoia and uh, you know, I\\'m not about so that we can come up back there uh concept. And the depression document, is that right now? The one is a great, great more forward. Yeah. Let\\'s let\\'s have an internal catsup on this along with Christina and Adam after this car. Uh Adam can adam can let uh I didn\\'t know about the next uh call and and the following following steps. Yeah absolutely we\\'ll go offline and have an internal conversation with George and Daniel. I\\'ll catch up with you with next steps and very soon and we can take from there but absolute pleasure drilling into this. I mean you know it\\'s very very cool. It\\'s just it\\'s just I just I just hope you know any questions or worries about like I think that\\'s why it would have been good to send this recording on and get T. G. Labs have an input um when anything like sports betting related you guys are coming up and going on you know how how does this fit? Um You know hopefully they will be there to to answer those questions. Yeah yeah we will share the recording so they will get as soon as it\\'s rendered, but as you mentioned, you know, you said, you guys have experienced in building liquidity kind of pause before right. So yeah, we\\'ve got, we\\'ve got, we\\'ve got some good defy experience, we spent a lot of time sort of looking at stuff like that, building things. So yeah, you know, that\\'s that, that, that part of the solution that we can bring for sure, Great. And I guess as much code as you can already use us out there, whether or not that sport texas or anything, you know, I\\'m actually five of that um, in terms of like time saving of how it all works, so yeah, absolutely. Okay, well, we, we know our next steps and only as with you guys are flying about the next steps from, from our side, but it\\'s been an absolute pleasure connecting with you today and learning more and, you know, hearing it straight from, from, from, from the founders mouth is always very good. And yeah, absolutely, we\\'ll look back with any other questions we have. So leave us to spend some time discussing internally and obviously we\\'ve got a group open so I can, I can act as a point of contact for any other questions that you might, we might have, but I think we\\'re good for now, so we\\'ll let you get on with your day. We were banging guys. We were only five minutes over and that\\'s good. Okay, thanks a lot. Thank you. Thanks guys. Uh, can you just stop recording now? Thank you.\"}'"
